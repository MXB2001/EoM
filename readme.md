# The Era of Myths - Development Version

**Some changes to 5.18 are**
- Semi-Portraits for the Celestials by tommy2teeth
- Portraits for the Elementals
- Changed the stats of the Elementals based on WoL era.
- Balancing for the Devlings by IPS ( https://r.wesnoth.org/p601712 )
- Unified regeneration ability for the Elementals
- Shifting animations for the Therians
- And more ...

**Things which are not yet ready:**
- The shifting animation for movement can't stay like that
- The regeneration ability could need another name (The current one is fine in English language, but not with the translation)
- Balancing of the Elementals - are the WoL stats better or worse?
