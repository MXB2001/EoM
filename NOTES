		----- The Era of Myths -----
           Notes for Development


*Animation Checklist:
*How do the changes to the Therians look. Should the shifting be quicker?
*Does the combination of moving and melee attacking look ok for the therian cat? (No, it doesn't ... )
*Does it look better if we make the tornado missile frame (zephyr/djinn) longer? -> looks fine now
*blood-manipulator: see below

*Checklist for other things:
*I changed the ranged icon for the Water Elemental. Better or Worse?
 (for comparison, the higher lvls don't have this change (yet?))

IDEAS:
how about using razorbird-attack image for a moving animation?

NOTES for later, about inconsitencies :
*lvl1 fire elemental: WoL plays first the fire sound, then the claws sound
 lvl2&3: WoL plays them the same time, we play first the fire sound (swapped behavior to lvl 1)
*compare Air Elemental's (lvl0) recruit animation with the one in EoC / WoL
*recheck lvl 1&2 earth elemental, noted sth. is probably better about the animation in WoL
*have unified aura wave animation among therians and wargs


IDEAS about Graphics:
*Make the flyers and attackers fly, too, by moving the picture a few pixels up and down
*Maybe we could uses this: https://r.wesnoth.org/p382676
    -> there was critics about the moon blade sword
    -> the animation with two attacks, maybe we can split it in two animations
*The main problem with the blood manipulator animation seems to be that he's higher in the attack frames, there is an in-between frame needed to the base and defense frame
*there is a brighter version of the vine attack icon in ageless - switching to that one?
*there is an alternative icicle icon in WoL


Resurgence Ability:
*not sure about the non-forest terrains of the vine-type resurgence
*beach sands for the desert resurgence? the casual player probably won't divide between them
 an completely different idea would be to give the regenartion when beeing adjacent (and on) Ql*^* tiles
*having 5 regeneration + the good movetype on their favored terrain ... maybe this makes them to defensive, and the regeneration should be 4 (like small heal, it were 3 before)
*snow AND water resurgence for ice elementals?

RELESE BLOCKING:
how to name the resurgence ability (and the special_notes for them)
update translations afterdwards
we can make a release with leaving out the elementals balance changes (but still including the new resurgence)
