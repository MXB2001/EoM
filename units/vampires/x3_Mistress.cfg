These vampiresses are capable of unleashing a world of pain and suffering upon their enemies with their twin daggers and their dementing gaze. The minions and mercenaries which serve her fight significantly better whenever they around her, sometimes it is unknown whether she is leading them or the mercenaries and minions are protecting her in order to protect themselves from the wrath of the Mistress husband."
